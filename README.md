Hi! I'm learning:
- how to write assembly for GNU x86-64
- how to read and debug assembly files
- how to use `gdb`, `cgdb`, `rr`, `objdump`
- what are some calling conventions in Linux
- what are the syscalls
- how registers work

etc. etc.

I started from writing a simpler version of `pwd`, which just wraps `getcwd`.
